# ⚡ ChronoPwn 9.0 - The Singularity Engine

ChronoPwn is a powerful cyber attack-analysis platform developed to simulate hacking of digital and physical systems. It relies on fractal AI, time-based exploitation, and dynamic reverse engineering, making it the closest tool to an AI capable of performing **fully automated attack operations**.

## 🌟 Key Features

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🧠 **Fractal AI Engine** | Self-learning AI engine that evolves automatically with each hack and discovers Zero-Day vulnerabilities instantly |
| ⏳ **Time-based Exploitation** | Attacks systems during short time windows undetectable by traditional security systems |
| 🌐 **Air-Gap Infiltration** | Breaches air-gapped systems via audio, light, or radio signals without physical connection |
| 🔓 **Payload Generator** | Generates custom payloads for target systems (Windows, Linux, IoT) |
| 🌍 **Global Control Dashboard** | Professional dashboard showing interactive maps, attack logs, and direct target control |
| 📡 **Advanced C2 Framework** | Fully encrypted command and control server managing communication with target devices |
| 🧬 **Quantum Simulation Layer** | Experimental layer for simulating quantum encryption system breaches |
